Description: Makefile generator
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating Makefile.in files
 (used, in turn by autoconf to generate Makefiles) from Makefile.am
 files.  Each Makefile.am is basically a series of make macro
 definitions (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 Makefile.in files are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
